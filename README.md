# Asante AI:

Asante AI is an AI powered safari recommendation engine for African travel destinations. 

<br/>

Asante AI is built to promote African wildlife conservation by encouraging wildlife tourism and empowering local communities through conservation-friendly development.

<br/>

Users search through our catalogue of AI recommended wildlife travel destinations, find their perfect holiday destination, and place a booking.

<br/>

It's hoped that the more tourists visit these African wildlife national parks, the greater the endeavour to protect them. 

<br/>

The web app uses Square's Web Payments SDK to process booking payments (https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments).

<br/>

And Appwrite Cloud is used as the Backend Database to save the payments processed (https://cloud.appwrite.io), and manage user accounts.
